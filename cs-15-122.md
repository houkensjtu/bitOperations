#### Environment setup

1.Download C0 compiler and config PATH.

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$Path_to_cc0_bin
```

2.Try both Vim and Emacs to edit a simple file. Type in simple statements and save.

3.Compile your c0 file and run. **"-d" flag means dynamic check** and will check **all function contracts start with //@.**

```bash
cc0 -d factorial.c0
./a.out
```

4.Or, you can run your code in the interpreter **coin**.

```bash
$ coin -d factorial.c0
$ C0 interpreter (coin)
Type ‘#help’ for help or ‘#quit’ to exit.
--> factorial(2);
--> factorial(3);
```

> On my W530, installed C0 compiler at /opt/C0/cc0/bin; PATH added in .bashrc.

#### Lecture 1 Contracts

> Contracts will play a central role in this class, since they represent the key to connect algorithmic ideas to imperative programs.

```c
// A mysterious function
int f(int x, int y)
{
  int r = 1;
  while (y > 1) {
    if (y % 2 == 1) {
      r = x * r;
    }
    x = x * x;
    y = y / 2;
  }
  return r * x;
}
```

* Seems it returns x^y, but doesn't make sure y is positive, also behavior is not well defined when y is odd.
* By hand calculating the loop, we discovered that x ^ y is constant through the loop. Proof

$$
x' = x\cdot x, y' =y/2 \\
x' ^{y'} = (x\cdot x)^{y/2} =x^y
$$
